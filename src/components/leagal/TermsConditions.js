                        <li>You, as an independent contractor, shall devote your best efforts, attention and skill to the diligent, faithful,
                            efficient and competent performance of your duties and responsibilities customary to the Services you have elected to
                            perform, in a safe and professional manner.</li>
                        <li>Notwithstanding that you are not employed by the Company, as the Company is involved in facilitating your engagement to
                            perform Services for the Principals, you shall conduct yourself in a safe and professional manner and refrain from any
                            activity or conduct that is prejudicial to the reputation of the Company or its affiliates, or make any statement which

                            Principal.</li>
                        <li>If you are unable to provide the Services in whole or in part at the agreed date, time and venue, you shall notify and

                            hours prior to the date that your Services, or the remainder of your Services are required. Failure to notify the
                            Company in accordance with this clause will result in the Company being entitled to levy a sum of S$ 25 on you, which
                            the Company may at its sole discretion set off against any monies that may be due and owing to you (which includes any

                            agree that the said sum is a reasonable estimate of the actual loss that the Company would suffer in having to make
                            alternative provisions for the provision of Services, or the remainder of the Services on short notice. For the
                            avoidance of doubt, the Company will not levy such sums on you if you are able to furnish within a reasonable time
                            sufficient documentary evidence that you were unable to provide the Services due to illness or injury</li>
                        <li>Without prejudice to clauses 2.3 and 2.5 above, if in the event that you are found by either the Company or the

                            reported late at the agreed time, date and venue, improperly groomed or dressed at the agreed date, time and venue, or
                            if you do not perform the Services in a safe or professional manner, the Company and the Principal shall have the sole
                            and absolute discretion to cease the provision of your Services in whole or in part, and the Company is entitled to levy
                            a sum of S$ 25 on you, which the Company may at its sole discretion set off against any monies that may be due and owing
                            to you (which includes any accrued sums from partial performance of a Service). In the event, that the Company levies a
                            sum of S$ 25 on you, you agree that the said sum is a reasonable estimate of the actual loss that the Company would

                            perform the Services in whole or in part on your behalf, provided that the substitute shall be an existing user of the
                            Platforms and has entered into a contract substantially in the same form as this Agreement with the Company. In the
                            event that a substitute is appointed and such substitute confirms his appointment, the Company shall remove your
                            registration for the relevant Service and register the substitute for the relevant Service (or remainder thereof), and

                            your Services are required. If a substitute performs the Services without the agreement of the Company, the Company
                            shall have the right to deem the Services not performed and neither you nor the substitute shall be entitled to payment
                            for the portion of the Services performed by the substitute</li>
                        <li>You have no authority (and shall not hold yourself out as having authority) to bind the Company.</li>

                            foregoing, you are responsible for keeping appropriate personal records (including where applicable time sheets) in
                            accordance with clause 2.4 above for the purposes of resolving disputes or assisting the Company in the calculation of
                            payment due to you. Please note that in the event you have not kept such records or are unable to provide (as required)
                            such records to the Company, the Company may be unable to resolve any disputes with the Principals in relation to the
                            payments due to you and payments due to you will be affected accordingly.

                        <li>
                            For avoidance of doubt, as you are an independent contractor of the Company, you are not entitled to, and the Company
                            does not provide, employee’s Central Provident Fund payments or workmen’s compensation insurance coverage (or other
